            What is a brand?
        </h1>
        <p>
            A brand is a set of visual assets, stylistic choices, and other resources that combine to form a cohesive
            image. A brand is more than a logo, name, or slogan. It could include almost anything that contributes to
            your company’s reputation — like the tone used in your messaging or the dress code for your employees. The
            various ways you’re perceived by the public is your brand.

            A strong brand image helps differentiate your business from the competition. If you can establish a positive
            impression among your audience, attracting leads and retaining existing customers will become easier over
            time. This could lead to organic marketing as loyal customers feel inclined to advocate for your brand.

        <h3>Identifying Your Audience</h3>
        <p>
            Before you can work out how to develop a brand, you first need to think about who that brand is for. Clearly
            identifying your target audience is an easy step to skip in brand building, but the reality is that
            different people respond to different tones, aesthetics, and brand personalities. If you start by
            considering what that audience is looking for, you’ll have much less trouble designing a brand that engages
            and connects with them.

        <h3>Research Your Competition</h3>
        <p>
            Conduct competitor research to get a better idea of how to cultivate a unique niche. Find a way to match
            competitors’ strengths while capitalizing on weaknesses like market inefficiencies or underserved sectors.

            Examine other areas of competing brands as well, like websites, pricing, and voice. Strong SEO practices can
            generate steady web traffic through organic search, and competing websites should give you a good idea of
            which topics to target. You can also use keyword research tools to identify subjects that aren’t being
            targeted yet by competitors.

        <h3>Develop a personality and brand voice</h3>
        <p>
            Personality is one of the most important aspects of your brand. It’s the easiest way to demonstrate that
            your company is unique, and it’s what will attract the type of customers you want.

            The same voice should echo across brand operations — from web copy and social media profiles, to emails and
            product pages. Whenever a customer interacts with your brand, they should hear the distinct brand voice and
            see your personality. The voice you choose will depend largely on your audience, mission statement, and
            industry. For example, Gen Z audiences often use slang, so you might consider integrating that into your
            brand voice if you want to connect with that type of audience.
